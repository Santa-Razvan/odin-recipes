        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 (3 pound) whole chicken</li>
                <li>4 carrots, halved</li>
                <li>4 stalks celery, halved</li>
                <li>1 large onion. halved</li>

                <li>1 teaspoon chicken bouillon granules (Optional)</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Place chicken, carrots, celery, and onion in a large 
                    soup pot; add enough cold water to cover. Bring to a 
                    boil over medium heat; reduce heat to low and simmer, 
                    uncovered, until meat falls off of the bone, about 90 
                    minutes. Skim off foam every so often, as needed.
                </li>
                <li>Remove chicken from the pot and let sit until cool 
                    enough to handle; chop meat into pieces, and discard 
                    skin and bones.
                </li>
                <li>Strain out vegetables, reserving the stock; rinse the 
                    soup pot and return the stock to the pot. Chop 
                    vegetables into smaller pieces; return chopped chicken 
                    and vegetables to the pot.
                </li>
                <li>Warm soup until heated through; season with salt, 
                    pepper, and chicken bouillon to taste.
                </li>

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>My mother was one of the best cooks I ever knew. Whenever 
            she made stews we mostly found homemade dumplings in 
            them. We never ate things from packages or microwaves 
            and you sure could taste what food was. That's the 
            only way I cook today - I don't use any electronic 
            gadgets to cook with except an electric stove.
        </p>
        <p>Have a hankering for light, fluffy, tender dumplings 
            just like your mom used to make? You've come to the 
            right place. These homemade dumplings are easy to 
            make with just six pantry staples – and they're 
            even easier to eat. With this top-rated recipe, 
            you'll make perfect dumplings every time.
